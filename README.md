# Developer-Portfolio 

## Description
My web development portfolio.
## Deployment
The portfolio is deployed using GitHub Pages. The site can be accessed at: https://aywink.github.io/Developer-Portfolio/
## Usage
The elements of the webpage resizes so that the webpage is accessible on different screens. The header is fixed at the top of the viewport with a navigation bar. The elements within the navigation bar can be hovered to improve readability of links. The webpage features a welcome section with a photo and "hello there!" text layered on top of a background image using CSS grid layout. The main section of the webpage includes an about me, work, and contact sections formed using CSS flexbox column layout. There are two dummy elements before the about me and work headings to improve usage of navigation using the fixed header.

The about me section is contained in another flexbox column layout within the main section followed by a grid layout featuring deployed web applications within interactive image boxes.

The images have a lowered opacity so that the white text is easily readable if the image is similarly coloured. Hovering over the images reveals the images and adds shadow to the text to improve readability. Hovering over the text on the images also does not disrupt this function. The opacity is set to 100% and background is added to the text to improve user experience on smaller devices (assumes touchscreens).

The contact section includes icons linking to telephone, email, GitHub, and LinkedIn. When hovered over, the hovered icon increases in size to improve clarity. This effect is removed for devices with very small screens (typically only smartphones).
